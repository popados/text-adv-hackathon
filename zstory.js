//FIRST ROOM - ENTRYHALL AND START
// Intro 1: Eerie Silence
const firstRoomIntroOne =  "You step into the room, and an unnatural stillness greets you. Dust particles float in the dim light, and the air is thick, almost heavy, as if the room itself is holding its breath. Shadows cling to the corners, stretching and shifting as if theyre alive. Ahead, a faint outline of something metallic catches your eye—a puzzle piece, perhaps? You feel a chill run down your spine as you step further in, your footsteps muffled by the silence."

// Intro 2: Forgotten Mystery
const firstRoomIntroTwo = "The door creaks open, revealing a room lost to time. Shelves line the walls, filled with books and oddities covered in a thick layer of dust. Strange markings are etched into the floor, leading toward an ancient-looking puzzle on a pedestal in the center. As you enter, a soft whisper seems to echo from the walls, urging you to solve what lies ahead. You can almost feel the room watching, waiting for you to unlock its secrets."

// Intro 3: Looming Darkness
const firstRoomIntroThree =  "A cold draft flows through the door as you step into the room. Barely visible in the dimness, an assortment of objects lies scattered across the floor, some broken, others curiously arranged. Flickering lights cast long shadows, revealing an intricate puzzle in the middle of the room. The silence is punctuated by distant, unidentifiable sounds, as if the room itself is groaning under a hidden weight. You feel a sense of urgency—youre not sure why, but it feels like this room holds something more than just a puzzle."

// LEFT ROOM - LAB AND EXPERIMENT ROOM
// Intro 1: Cold and Clinical Horror
const leftRoomDescOne = "You push open the heavy door to the left and are greeted by the stark brightness of a laboratory filled with cold metal and gleaming glass. A sickly, antiseptic odor lingers in the air, mixing with something else—something metallic and dark. Tables are cluttered with strange instruments, their cruel designs hinting at purposes best left unknown. Against one wall, rusty chains dangle ominously, as if waiting for the next unwilling occupant. In the center of the room, a puzzle mechanism glints with fresh, polished edges, standing in disturbing contrast to the decay around it."

// Intro 2: Macabre and Chaotic
const leftRoomDescTwo =  "The door creaks open to reveal a chaotic scene of abandoned experiments and long-forgotten horrors. Broken vials and shattered glass litter the floor, while dark stains splatter the walls, hinting at a past soaked in suffering. The flickering light casts strange shadows on the walls, where strange diagrams are scrawled in frantic, looping script. Near the far wall, a sinister-looking apparatus sits half-assembled, its purpose unclear yet unnervingly malevolent. In the center of it all, a puzzle device sits—part of the machinery or a test for those who dare enter this chamber."

// Intro 3: Shadows of Suffering
const leftRoomDescThree = "You enter the room, and an overwhelming sense of dread washes over you. The air is thick with the stench of chemicals, stale and almost suffocating. Shadows cling to the dark stone walls, casting twisted shapes over worn leather straps and metal restraints bolted to a table in the center. Strange devices are scattered on shelves, their jagged edges gleaming faintly. A puzzle box lies on one of the tables, surrounded by syringes and vials with faded labels. Every object here feels touched by the suffering of those who came before you—and perhaps waits for the next unfortunate visitor."

//RIGHT ROOM - DUNGEON
// Intro 1: Shattered Silence
const rightRoomDescOne = "You step into the room, and rows of large glass tubes greet you, each containing strange, preserved specimens suspended in cloudy liquid. The faint hum of machinery fills the air, but one tube catches your eye immediately. Its shattered, the glass scattered across the floor, and the liquid pooled beneath it. Whatever was once inside is gone. Nearby, faint, wet footprints lead into the darkness, disappearing among the shadows. You suddenly feel the weight of silence pressing in, as if something is watching… or waiting."

// Intro 2: Sinister Experimentation
const rightRoomDescTwo = "Dim, greenish lights illuminate the dungeon-like room, casting an unnatural glow over rows of test tubes that line the walls. Strange, malformed creatures float within each one, preserved in eerie stillness. Except one. A broken tube near the far corner gapes open, with fragments of glass lying across the floor and a sticky residue marking where something… escaped. A faint, rhythmic sound echoes through the chamber, but you can't tell if it's your imagination or something lurking just out of sight."

// Intro 3: Echoes of Life
const rightRoomDescThree = "The air in this room feels stale and thick, each breath heavy with the smell of formaldehyde. Rows of towering glass tubes line the walls, filled with preserved creatures that seem to hover in lifeless stasis. All but one. A large, jagged hole in the glass reveals a broken test tube, with faint claw marks etched into the table beneath it. Whatever was inside is gone. You sense movement in the shadows, a faint scratching sound echoing off the walls, as though the experiment might still be nearby, hidden and watching."
