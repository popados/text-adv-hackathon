//Examine test tubes in the room
const testTubes = "You see rows of test tubes fill with some kind of liquid and strange creatures inside, you get the feeling that they may not all be as dormant as they appear"

//Looking at the broken test tube
const brokenTestTube = "You examine the broken test tube and it's apparent that the break has happened recently, there is still liquid on the floor and you can make out a watery trail leading off deeper into this electronic dungeon."

//Inspecting the glass on the floor
const shatteredGlass = "The glass from the tube seems to be thicker than normal glass almost the size of ballistic glass. While most of the the glass surrounds the tube there is a number of shards further from the tube. You come to the realization, What ever broke out, did it from inside the tube."

//See something shining
const shinyObject = "You see something shining in the corner of the room, upon looking closer you can tell its a key. Unfortunately this key is hung around 'somethings' neck and you will have to remove it."

//aggressively take the key from the pile
const takeTheKeyHard = "You chose to disregard any care since whoever put you here has done the same. As you remove the key from the mass of flesh you give it a hard yank and the key comes free. You turn to leave and behind you there is a sound.... something is stiring."

//Monster attacks after taking the Key
const experimentAttacks = "As you take the key to the door you can't help but feel something following you. You turn to see and one of the experiments is standing before you ready to kill. From the corner of your eye you see a rusty pipe and decide to arm yourself and ready to fight this thing off. You dont know where you are or what this thing is. But you are sure of one thing, 'You're not dying today' "

//Monster defeated
const battleVictory = "Standing over the experiment that has now stopped moving you breathe heavy that its finally over. With a sigh of relief you head back to the main room still carrying your pipe in case another shows up"

//Monster wins
const battleDefeat = "Apparently its not wise to fight against a monster you have come across in this unknown place. Surely there were better options than fighting a 'thing' with a rusty pipe. Did you think you were in a video game or something? As you lay there clinging to life, you start to fade as the monster takes the key from you and goes back to his happy little corner."
